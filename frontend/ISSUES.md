# Frontend Issues

**This document is an archive of resolved issues. The application is now stable and ready for beta testing.**

All major frontend issues that were previously blocking development have been resolved. These include:

*   **Application Not Rendering:** A critical bug that caused an infinite loading screen has been fixed. The application now renders correctly on all platforms.
*   **Android Build Failure:** The Android build is now functional, unblocking the path to a beta release.

For a detailed summary of all resolved issues, please see the main [`testing_and_issues.md`](../../testing_and_issues.md) document.

## Current Focus

The primary focus is now on preparing for the Android beta release. While the application is stable, there is no frontend testing in place. This is a known limitation.
