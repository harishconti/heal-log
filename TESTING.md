# Testing

## Backend Tests

To run the backend tests, you will need to have `pytest` and all the dependencies in `backend/requirements.txt` installed.

1.  Navigate to the root of the project.
2.  Run the test script:

    ```bash
    ./run_backend_tests.sh
    ```

    This script will handle setting the `PYTHONPATH` and other necessary environment variables.
